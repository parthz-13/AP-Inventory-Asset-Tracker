### Project Title: Inventory & Asset Tracker
### Team Members:

- Parth Kumar Singh

- Veer Shah

- Karan Rawat

- Ganesh Wayal

## 2. Problem Statement

Many small shopkeepers and local businesses struggle to efficiently manage their stock, suppliers, and sales records. Traditional methods such as maintaining physical ledgers or Excel sheets are prone to errors, data loss, and inefficiency.
This lack of automation leads to stock mismanagement, delayed reordering, and difficulty in tracking profits or sales trends.

The problem is significant for local retailers and wholesalers, especially those without access to complex ERP systems, who need an affordable and easy-to-use inventory tracking solution.

## 3. Proposed Solution

Our proposed solution ‚Äî Inventory & Asset Tracker ‚Äî is a web-based platform designed to digitize inventory and asset management for small business owners.

### The system allows users to:

- Add, edit, and manage items and stock levels in real-time.

- Automatically adjust stock when a sale occurs.

- Get low-stock alerts and sales analytics.

- Manage supplier information and link items to vendors.

- Generate bills and invoices through an integrated billing module.

This simplifies day-to-day operations, reduces manual workload, and provides insights for better decision-making.

## 4. Target Audience

- Small and medium shopkeepers (retailers, wholesalers).

- Local business owners managing physical stock.

- Warehouse managers who require real-time stock tracking.

- Service providers maintaining equipment or assets.

These users typically need a simple, intuitive, and low-cost solution for inventory tracking without needing technical expertise.

## 5. Market Research & Existing Alternatives

Existing platforms like Zoho Inventory, Tally ERP, and Vyapar App offer inventory management solutions, but:

- They are expensive or complex for small-scale businesses.

- They often require installation and training, limiting accessibility.

- Most free versions have restricted functionality.

Our solution is web-based, lightweight, and open-source, making it ideal for local entrepreneurs and students building scalable solutions.
